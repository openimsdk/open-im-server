# OpenIM Tools Control Script
#
# Description:
#  This script is responsible for managing the lifecycle of OpenIM tools, which include starting, stopping,
#  and handling pre and post operations. It's designed to be modular and extensible, ensuring that the 
#  individual operations can be managed separately, and integrated seamlessly with Linux systemd.
# 
# Features:
# 1. Robust error handling using Bash built-ins like 'errexit', 'nounset', and 'pipefail'.
# 2. The capability to source common utility functions and configurations to ensure uniform environmental settings.
# 3. Comprehensive logging functionalities, providing a detailed understanding of operational processes.
# 4. Provision for declaring and managing a set of OpenIM tools, each associated with its unique name and corresponding ports.
# 5. The ability to define and associate Prometheus ports for service monitoring purposes.
# 6. Functionalities to start each OpenIM tool, along with its designated ports, in a sequence.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Direct Script Execution:
#    This initiates all the OpenIM tools declared under the function openim::tools::service_name.
#    Example: ./openim-tools.sh  openim::tools::start
# 2. Controlling through Functions for systemctl operations:
#    Specific operations like installation, uninstallation, and status check can be executed by passing the respective function name as an argument to the script.
#    Example: ./openim-tools.sh openim::tools::install
#

set +o nounset
