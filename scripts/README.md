```

The purpose of having a structured scripts directory like this is to make the operations of OpenIM Server clear and easy to manage. Each script has its own responsibility, making it easier to maintain and update. It's also helpful for newcomers who can easily understand what each part of the system is doing by just looking at this directory structure.

Each directory and script in the structure should be understood as a part of a larger whole. All scripts work together to ensure the smooth operation and maintenance of the OpenIM Server.


## log directory

**PATH:** `scripts/lib/logging.sh`

+ [log details](../docs/conversions/bash_log.md)

## Supported platforms

- Linux x86_64 (linux_amd64) : 64-bit Linux for most desktop and server systems.

- Windows x86_64 (windows_amd64) : 64-bit version for most Windows operating systems.

- macOS x86_64 (darwin_amd64) : 64-bit version for Apple Macintosh computers.

- Linux ARM64 (linux_arm64) : For ARM-based 64-bit Linux systems such as Raspberry Pi 4 and Jetson Nano.

- Linux s390x (linux_s390x) : 64-bit Linux for IBM System z hosts.

- Linux MIPS64 (linux_mips64) : 64-bit Linux for MIPS architecture.

- Linux MIPS64LE (linux_mips64le) : Suitable for 64-bit Linux systems with little endian MIPS architecture.

## Get started quickly - demo.sh

Is the `demo.sh` script teaching you how to quickly get started with OpenIM development and use


Steps to run demo:

```sh
$ make demo
```

More about `make` read:

+ [makefile](../docs/conversions/go_code.md)

Instructions for producing the demo movie:

```bash
# Create temporary directory
mkdir /tmp/kb-demo
cd /tmp/kb-demo

asciinema rec
<path-to-KB-repo>/scripts/demo/run.sh

<CTRL-C> to terminate the script
<CTRL-D> to terminate the asciinema recording
<CTRL-C> to save the recording locally

# Edit the recorded file by editing the controller-gen path
# Once you are happy with the recording, use svg-term program to generate the svg

svg-term --cast=<movie-id> --out _output/demo.svg --window
```

Here you will learn how to test a script, We take the four functions for starting and checking a service as an example.

## Guide: Using and Understanding OpenIM Utility Functions

This document provides an overview of the four utility functions designed for managing processes and services. These functions can check the status of services based on ports and process names, as well as stop services based on the same criteria.

### Table of Contents
- [1. Checking the Status of Services by Ports](#checking-the-status-of-services-by-ports)
- [2. Checking the Status of Services by Process Names](#checking-the-status-of-services-by-process-names)
- [3. Stopping Services by Ports](#stopping-services-by-ports)
- [4. Stopping Services by Process Names](#stopping-services-by-process-names)

### 1. Checking the Status of Services by Ports

#### Function: `openim::util::check_ports`

This function checks the status of services running on specified ports.

**Usage**:

```bash
$ openim::util::check_ports <port1> <port2> ...
```

**Design**:

- The function iterates through each provided port.
- It uses the `lsof` command to identify if there is a service running on the specified port.
- If a service is running, it logs the command, PID, and start time of the service.
- If a service is not running, it logs that the port is not started.
- If any service is not running, the function returns a status of 1.

#### Example:

```bash
$ openim::util::check_ports 8080 8081 8082
```

### 2. Checking the Status of Services by Process Names

#### Function: `openim::util::check_process_names`

This function checks the status of services based on their process names.

**Usage**:

```bash
$ openim::util::check_process_names <process_name1> <process_name2> ...
```

**Design**:

- The function uses `pgrep` to find process IDs associated with the given process names.
- If processes are found, it logs the command, PID, associated port, and start time.
- If no processes are found for a name, it logs that the process is not started.
- If any process is not running, the function returns a status of 1.

#### Example:

```bash
$ openim::util::check_process_names nginx mysql redis
```

### 3. Stopping Services by Ports

#### Function: `openim::util::stop_services_on_ports`

This function attempts to stop services running on the specified ports.

**Usage**:

```bash
$ openim::util::stop_services_on_ports <port1> <port2> ...
```

**Design**:

- The function uses the `lsof` command to identify services running on the specified ports.
- If a service is running on a port, it tries to terminate the associated process using the `kill` command.
- It logs successful terminations and any failures.
- If any service couldn't be stopped, the function returns a status of 1.

#### Example:

```bash
$ openim::util::stop_services_on_ports 8080 8081 8082
```

### 4. Stopping Services by Process Names

#### Function: `openim::util::stop_services_with_name`

This function attempts to stop services based on their process names.

**Usage**:

```bash
$ openim::util::stop_services_with_name <process_name1> <process_name2> ...
```

**Design**:

- The function uses `pgrep` to identify processes associated with the specified names.
- If processes are found, it tries to terminate them using the `kill` command.
- It logs successful terminations and any failures.
- If any service couldn't be stopped, the function returns a status of 1.

#### Example:

```bash
$ openim::util::stop_services_with_name nginx apache
```

### system management and installation of openim via Linux system

```bash
$ ./scripts/install/install.sh
```

## examples
Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations.

The script directory design of OpenIM and the writing of scripts and tools refer to many excellent open source projects, such as helm, iam, kubernetes, docker, etc.

Maybe they'll give you inspiration for later maintenance...

These scripts keep the root level Makefile small and simple.
