  # Error SC2155 indicates that you should separate variable declaration and assignment to avoid masking the return value of the command.
  # In Bash scripts, when you declare and assign a local variable at the same time a command is executed, you only get the output of the command, but not the exit status (return value) of the command.  #
  2155
  # ShellCheck issues SC2086 warnings when you refer to a variable in a script but don't put it in double quotes.This can lead to unexpected behavior when scripts encounter Spaces, 
  # newlines, and wildcards in file names or other data.
