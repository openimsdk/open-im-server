# This script assists in managing Git hooks for the OpenIM project.
# When executed:

# 3. If requested, it can delete the added hooks.
#
# This script equal runs `make init-githooks` command.
# Usage:
# ./init-githooks.sh              Prompt to enable git hooks.
# ./init-githooks.sh --delete     Delete previously added git hooks.
# ./init-githooks.sh --help       Show the help message.
