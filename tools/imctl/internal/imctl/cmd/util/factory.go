// Factory provides abstractions that allow the IAM command to be extended across multiple types
// of resources and different API sets.
// The rings are here for a reason. In order for composers to be able to provide alternative factory implementations
// they need to provide low level pieces of *certain* functions so that when the factory calls back into itself
// it uses the custom version of the function. Rather than try to enumerate everything that someone would want to
// override
// we split the factory into rings, where each ring can depend on methods in an earlier ring, but cannot depend
// upon peer methods in its own ring.
// TODO: make the functions interfaces
// TODO: pass the various interfaces on the factory directly into the command constructors (so the
// commands are decoupled from the factory).
