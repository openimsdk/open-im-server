## Summary

The OpenIM CTL module proposal aims to provide an integrated tool for the OpenIM system, offering utilities for user management, system monitoring, debugging, configuration, and more. This tool will enhance the extensibility of the OpenIM system and reduce dependencies on individual modules.

## Definitions

- **OpenIM**: An Instant Messaging system.
- **`imctl`**: The control command-line tool for OpenIM.
- **E2E Testing**: End-to-End Testing.
- **API**: Application Programming Interface.

## Motivation

- Improve the OpenIM system's extensibility and reduce dependencies on individual modules.
- Simplify the process for testers to perform automated tests.
- Enhance interaction with scripts and reduce the system's coupling.
- Implement a consistent tool similar to kubectl for a streamlined user experience.

## What it is

`imctl` is a command-line utility designed for OpenIM to provide functionalities including:

- User Management: Add, delete, or disable user accounts.
- System Monitoring: View metrics like online users, message transfer rate.
- Debugging: View logs, adjust log levels, check system states.
- Configuration Management: Update system settings, manage plugins/modules.
- Data Management: Backup, restore, import, or export data.
- System Maintenance: Update, restart services, or maintenance mode.

## How it Works

`imctl`, inspired by kubectl, will have sub-commands and options for the functionalities mentioned. Developers, operations, and testers can invoke these commands to manage and monitor the OpenIM system.

## Migration

Currently, the `imctl` will be housed in `tools/imctl`, and later on, the plan is to move it to `cmd/imctl`. Migration guidelines will be provided to ensure smooth transitions.

## Drawbacks

- Overhead in learning and adapting to a new tool for existing users.
- Potential complexities in implementing some of the advanced functionalities.

## Alternatives

- Continue using individual modules for OpenIM management.
- Utilize third-party tools or platforms with similar functionalities, customizing them for OpenIM.

## Prior Art

Kubectl from Kubernetes is a significant inspiration for `imctl`, offering a comprehensive command-line tool for managing clusters.

## Unresolved Questions

- What other functionalities might be required in future versions of `imctl`?
- What's the expected timeline for transitioning from `tools/imctl` to `cmd/imctl`?

## Spec. Changes (OPTIONAL)

As of now, there are no proposed changes to the core specifications or extensions. Future changes based on community feedback might necessitate spec changes, which will be documented accordingly.
