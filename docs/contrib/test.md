# OpenIM RPC Service Test Control Script Documentation

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing the `test.sh` script for testing OpenIM RPC services. The `test.sh` script is a collection of bash functions designed to test various aspects of the OpenIM RPC services, ensuring that each part of the API is functioning as expected.

For some complex, bulky functional tests, performance tests, and various e2e tests, We are all in the current warehouse to https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/tree/main/test or https://github.com/openim-sigs/test-infra directory In the.

## Usage

The `test.sh` script is located within the `./scripts/install/` directory of the OpenIM service's codebase. To use the script, navigate to this directory from your terminal:

```bash
cd ./scripts/install/
chmod +x test.sh
```

### Running the Entire Test Suite

To execute all available tests, you can either call the script directly or use the `make` command:

```
./test.sh openim::test::test
```

Or, if you have a `Makefile` that defines the `test-api` target:

```bash
make test-api
```

Alternatively, you can invoke specific test functions by passing them as arguments:

```
./test.sh openim::test::<function_name>
```

This `make` command should be equivalent to running `./test.sh openim::test::test`, provided that the `Makefile` is configured accordingly.



### Executing Individual Test Functions

If you wish to run a specific set of tests, you can call the relevant function by passing it as an argument to the script. Here are some examples:

**Message Tests:**

```bash
./test.sh openim::test::msg
```

**Authentication Tests:**

```bash
./test.sh openim::test::auth
```

**User Tests:**

```bash
./test.sh openim::test::user
```

**Friend Tests:**

```bash
./test.sh openim::test::friend
```

**Group Tests:**

```bash
./test.sh openim::test::group
```

Each of these commands will run the test suite associated with the specific functionality of the OpenIM service.



### Detailed Function Test Examples

T**esting Message Sending and Receiving:**

To test message functionality, the `openim::test::msg` function is called. It will register a user, send a message, and clear messages to ensure that the messaging service is operational.

```bash
./test.sh openim::test::msg
```

**Testing User Registration and Account Checks:**

The `openim::test::user` function will create new user accounts and perform a series of checks on these accounts to verify that user registration and account queries are functioning properly.

```bash
./test.sh openim::test::user
```

**Testing Friend Management:**

By invoking `openim::test::friend`, the script will test adding friends, checking friendship status, managing friend requests, and handling blacklisting.

```bash
./test.sh openim::test::friend
```

**Testing Group Operations:**

The `openim::test::group` function tests group creation, member addition, information retrieval, and member management within groups.

```bash
./test.sh openim::test::group
```

### Log Output

Each test function will output logs to the terminal to confirm the success or failure of the tests. These logs are crucial for identifying issues and verifying that each part of the service is tested thoroughly.

Each function logs its success upon completion, which aids in debugging and understanding the test flow. The success message is standardized across functions:

```
openim::log::success "<Test suite name> completed successfully."
```

By following the guidelines and instructions outlined in this document, you can effectively utilize the `test.sh` script to test and verify the OpenIM RPC services' functionality.
