# Examples Directory

Welcome to the `examples` directory of our project! This directory contains a collection of example files that demonstrate various configurations and setups for our software. These examples are designed to provide you with templates that can be used as a starting point for your own configurations.

## Overview

In this directory, you'll find examples for a variety of use cases. Each file is a template with default values and configurations that illustrate best practices and typical scenarios. Whether you're just getting started or looking to implement a complex setup, these examples should help you get on the right track.

## Structure

Here's a quick overview of what you'll find in this directory:

+ `env-example.yaml`: Demonstrates how to set up environment variables.
+ `openim-example.yaml`: A sample configuration file for the OpenIM application.
+ `prometheus-example.yml`: An example Prometheus configuration for monitoring.
+ `alertmanager-example.yml`: A template for setting up Alertmanager configurations.

## How to Use These Examples

To use these examples, simply copy the relevant file to your working directory and rename it as needed (e.g., removing the `-example` suffix). Then, modify the file according to your requirements.

### Tips for Using Example Files:

1. **Read the Comments**: Each file contains comments that explain various sections and settings. Make sure to read these comments for a better understanding of how to customize the file.
2. **Check for Required Changes**: Some examples might require mandatory changes (like setting specific environment variables) before they can be used effectively.
3. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure that the example files are compatible with the version of the software you are using.
