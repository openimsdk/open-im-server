# RPC Configuration (following OpenIM standard format)
rpc:
  # API or other RPCs can access this RPC through this IP; if left blank, the internal network IP is obtained by default
  registerIP: 
  # Listening IP; 0.0.0.0 means both internal and external IPs are listened to, if blank, the internal network IP is automatically obtained by default
  listenIP: 0.0.0.0
  # autoSetPorts indicates whether to automatically set the ports
  # if you use in kubernetes, set it to false
  autoSetPorts: true
  # List of ports that the RPC service listens on; configuring multiple ports will launch multiple instances. These must match the number of configured prometheus ports
  # It will only take effect when autoSetPorts is set to false.
  ports: [ 10800 ]

prometheus:
  # Whether to enable prometheus
  enable: true
  # Prometheus listening ports, must be consistent with the number of rpc.ports
  # It will only take effect when autoSetPorts is set to false.
  ports: [ 20800 ]

# Encryption Configuration
encryption:
  # Encryption mode: "aes", "signal", "hybrid"
  mode: "aes"  # Default to AES for compatibility
  
  # AES encryption settings (existing)
  aes:
    enabled: true
    
  # Signal Protocol settings
  signal:
    enabled: false  # Set to true when ready to use Signal Protocol
    preKeyBatch: 100                    # Max one-time prekeys per upload
    keyRotationInterval: "168h"         # 7 days
    sessionCleanupInterval: "720h"      # 30 days
