## What is Open-IM-Server

Open-IM-Server is a robust instant messaging server engineered using pure Golang, leveraging JSON over WebSocket for communication. The server treats everything as a message, facilitating straightforward customization without modifying the server code. Its microservice architecture enables deployment using clusters, ensuring high performance and scalability.

Whether you're looking to integrate instant messaging or real-time networking into your applications, Open-IM-Server is your go-to solution! :rocket:

It's important to note that Open-IM-Server isn't a standalone product, and it doesn't include account registration and login services. However, we've made your life easier by open-sourcing the [chat repository](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/chat) that includes login and registration features. Deploying the chat business server alongside Open-IM-Server quickly sets up a comprehensive chat product. :busts_in_silhouette:

## :rocket: Quick Start

<details>   <summary>Deploying with Docker Compose</summary>

1. Clone the project

```bash
# choose what you need
BRANCH=release-v3.1
git clone -b $BRANCH https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server openim && export openim=$(pwd)/openim && cd $openim && make build
```

> **Note**
>
> Read our release policy: https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-Server/blob/main/docs/conversions/version.md

2. Modify .env

```bash
USER=root #no need to modify
PASSWORD=openIM123  #A combination of 8 or more numbers and letters, this password applies to redis, mysql, mongo, as well as accessSecret in config/config.yaml
ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:10005 #minio's external service IP and port, or use the domain name storage.xx.xx, the app must be able to access this IP and port or domain,
API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:10002/object/ #the app must be able to access this IP and port or domain,
DATA_DIR=./  #designate large disk directory
```

3. Deploy and start

> **Note**
> This command can only be executed once. It will modify the component passwords in docker-compose based on the `PASSWORD` variable in `.env`, and modify the component passwords in `config/config.yaml`. If the password in `.env` changes, you need to first execute `docker-compose down`; `rm components -rf` and then execute this command.

```
make install
```

4. Check the service

```bash
make check
```
