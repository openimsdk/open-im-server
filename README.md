## :rocket: Quick Start

You can quickly learn OpenIM engineering solutions, all it takes is one simple command:

```bash
$ make demo
```

🤲 In order to facilitate the user experience, we have provided a variety of deployment solutions, you can choose your own deployment method according to the list below:

<!--
<details> <summary>Deploying with Docker Compose</summary>

It is recommended to use Docker Compose for deployment, which can easily and quickly deploy the entire OpenIM service on a single node

+ [https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker)


> **Note**
>
> If you don't know OpenIM's versioning policy, 📚Read our release policy: https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/blob/main/docs/contrib/version.md


</details> 

<details>  <summary>Compile from Source</summary>


Ur need `Go 1.20` or higher version, and `make`.


```bash
go version && make --version || echo "Error: One of the commands failed."
```

Version Details: https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/blob/main/docs/contrib/version.md

You can get the version number from the command below or from [github releases](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/tags).

```bash
$ curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/openimsdk/open-im-server/releases" | jq -r '.[].tag_name'
```

We have our own version management policy, if you are interested in our version management, I recommend reading [📚 OpenIM Version](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/blob/main/docs/contrib/version.md), We recommend using stable versions such as `v3.3.0` and `v3.2.0` whenever possible. `v3.1.1-alpha.3` as well as `v3.3.0-beta.0` and `v3.2.0-rc.0` are pre-release or beta versions and are not recommended.

Set `OPENIM_VERSION` environment variables for the latest `OPENIM_VERSION` number, or replace the `OPENIM_VERSION` for you to install the OpenIM-Server `OPENIM_VERSION`:

```bash
$ OPENIM_VERSION=`curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/openimsdk/open-im-server/releases/latest | grep -oE '"tag_name": "[^"]+"' | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f4`
# OPENIM_VERSION=v3.3.0
```

Deploy basic components at the click of a command:

```bash
# install openim dependency
$ git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server openim/openim-server && export openim=$(pwd)/openim/openim-server && cd $openim/openim-server && git checkout $OPENIM_VERSION
$ make init && docker compose up -d && make start && make check
```

> `make help` to help you see the instructions supported by OpenIM.


You can use the `make help-all` see OpenIM in action.
