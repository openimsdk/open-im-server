// Package auth provides the implementation of the authentication service.
// It uses Dubbo-go for RPC communication.
//
// The auth package is responsible for managing user authentication. It provides
// functions for user login, logout, and session management. The package interacts
// with the user database to verify user credentials and manage user sessions.
//
// The main function in this package is the Start function, which starts the
// authentication service. It initializes a new Dubbo-go server, registers the
// authentication service with the server, and then starts the server.
//
// Other important functions in this package include Login and Logout, which
// handle user login and logout respectively, and CheckSession, which checks
// whether a user session is valid.
