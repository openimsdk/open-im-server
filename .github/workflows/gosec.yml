# gosec is a source code security audit tool for the Go language. It performs a static 
# analysis of the Go code, looking for potential security problems. The main functions of gosec are:
#     1. Find common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).
#     2. Audit codes according to common security standards and find non-standard codes.
#     3. Assist the Go language engineer to write safe and reliable code.
