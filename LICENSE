# Open Source License

OpenIM is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, with the following additional conditions:

1. OpenIM may be utilized commercially, including as a backend service for other applications or as an application development platform for enterprises. 
A commercial license must be obtained from the producer if:
    - Under no circumstances may you operate a multi-tenant or multi-business environment using the OpenIM source code, whether or not you have modified the repository code. In other words, a single instance of OpenIM may not simultaneously serve multiple enterprises, nor may it serve multiple lines of business within the same enterprise.
   - If you intend to operate in such a multi-tenant or multi-business manner, you must obtain a commercial license from the producer in advance.

2. As a contributor, you should agree that:

   a. The producer can adjust the open-source agreement to be more strict or more relaxed as deemed necessary.  
   b. Your contributed code may be used for commercial purposes, including but not limited to its cloud business operations.

Apart from the specific conditions mentioned above, all other rights and restrictions follow the Apache License 2.0. Detailed information about the Apache License 2.0 can be found at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.
